          <h1>Spring</h1>
          <p>Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate
             seasons, succeeding winter and preceding summer. There are various
              technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies
               according to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring
                in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere
                 and vice versa. At the spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights are
                  approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing and nighttime
                   length decreasing as the season progresses until the Summer Solstice in June
                    (Northern Hemisphere) and December (Southern Hemisphere).Meteorologists generally
                     define four seasons in many climatic areas: spring, summer, autumn (fall), and winter. 
                     These are determined by the values of their average temperatures on a monthly basis, with 
                     each season lasting three months. The three warmest months are by definition summer, the three 
                     coldest months are winter, and the intervening gaps are spring and autumn. Meteorological spring
                      can therefore, start on different dates in different regions.
                    In the US and UK, spring months are March, April, and May.[1][2]
                    In Australia[3] and New Zealand,[4][5] spring begins on 22nd or 23rd of September and ends on 21 December.
                    In Ireland, following the Gaelic calendar, spring is often defined as February, March, and April.[6][7]
                    In Sweden, meteorologists define the beginning of spring as the first occasion on which the average 24 hours
                     temperature exceeds zero degrees Celsius for seven consecutive days, thus the date varies with latitude and
                      elevation.
                    In Brazil, spring months are September, October, November.</p>
